# Hello there!
I am Nicephorus, a hobbyist developer with a (rather unhealthy) love for low-level and systems programming.
I mainly write code for microcontrollers such as Espressif's ESP32, Raspberry Pi's RP 2040 and 2350, amongst others.
Oftentimes though, I may write code that is on a totally different field (such as a **simulator**, *hinting nowhere...*).
If you wish to do so, get in contact with me!
